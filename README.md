## Overview

**DribbleData** is a small web app that tracks in‑game events and turns them into easy‑to‑read player stats.

## Why We Built It
Official stat sites are crowded and slow. We wanted a one‑page dashboard that tells a player’s story in seconds—perfect for fans, fantasy GMs, or quick research.
